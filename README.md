# Machine Learning Kata

This kata will test your knowledge of machine learning systems and some of the core concepts.

NASA has asked you to model a set of sensor data they have provided to accurately predict the state of their radiator subsystem on the space shuttle. 

The file labeled **shuttle.trn** contained within this repo is a portion of their data they have set aside to train your model. **shuttle.tst** is the set they are saving to validate the accuracy of the solution you provide.

Within **shuttle.trn** there are 9 attributes available to generate your model. 

There are 7 different states that the radiator subsystem can be in:
```
1 Rad Flow 
2 Fpv Close 
3 Fpv Open 
4 High 
5 Bypass 
6 Bpv Close 
7 Bpv Open 
```

# Essay Questions
